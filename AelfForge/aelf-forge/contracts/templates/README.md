## Introduction

The aelf forge platform is a powerful blockchain framework for developing decentralized applications. These smart contract templates provide a starting point for implementing common patterns and functionalities, making it easier to build secure and reliable dApps.

## Templates

### `Voting.cs`

- **Purpose:** Enables decentralized voting on proposals.
- **Features:**
    - Proposal creation.
    - Voting (yes/no or multiple options).
    - Result calculation.
- **Considerations:**
    - Token-based voting (optional).
    - Security measures (e.g., preventing duplicate votes).

### `TimelockController.cs`

- **Purpose:** Implements a time delay for executing critical transactions.
- **Features:**
    - Scheduling transactions for future execution.
    - Role-based authorization for executing transactions.
    - Timelock period configuration.
- **Considerations:**
    - Flexibility in delay settings.
    - Security measures (e.g., preventing unauthorized execution).

### `Ownable.cs`

- **Purpose:** Establishes ownership of a contract with access control.
- **Features:**
    - Single owner (initially the deployer).
    - Ownership transfer.
    - Owner-only functions.
- **Considerations:**
    - Two-step ownership transfer (optional).
    - Role-based access control (for more complex scenarios).

### `SafeMath.cs`

- **Purpose:** Provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.
- **Features:**
    - Safe addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
    - Error handling (assertions for overflow/underflow).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/aelf-forge-templates.git`
2. **Choose the template:** Select the template that best suits your needs.
3. **Customize:** Modify the template to fit your specific requirements.
4. **Deploy:** Compile and deploy the smart contract to the aelf forge blockchain.
